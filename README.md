- **Title:** A reference framework for the implementation of data governance systems for industry 4.0  
  - **Author(s):** Zorrilla, Marta and Yebenes, Juan  
  - **Publication Year:** 2022  
  - **Link:** [DOI](https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0920548921000908)  
  - **Abstract/Summary:** The fourth industrial revolution, or Industry 4.0, represents a new stage of evolution in the organization, management and control of the value chain throughout the product or service life cycle. This is mainly based on the digitalization of the industrial environment by means of the convergence of Information Technologies (IT) and operational Technologies (OT) through cyber-physical systems and the Industrial IoT (IIoT) and the use of data generated in real time for gaining insights and making decisions. Therefore data becomes a critical asset for Industry 4.0 and must be managed and governed like a strategic asset. This paper presents the design of a specific governance framework for Industry 4.0.

  - **Abstract/Summary:** Uberâ€™s business is highly real-time in nature. PBs of data are continuously being collected from end users such as Uber drivers, riders, restaurants, and others. There is a lot of valuable information to be processed, and many decisions must be made in seconds for a variety of use cases such as customer incentives, fraud detection, and machine learning model prediction. Additionally, there is an increasing need to expose this capability to various user categories, including engineers, data scientists, executives, and operations personnel. This paper presents the overall architecture of Uber's real-time data infrastructure and highlights three scaling challenges that need continuous attention for each component. Uber heavily relies on open-source technologies for key areas of the infrastructure and customizes them to fit its environment and scale.
